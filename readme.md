<h1>Sci-Fi-Api</h1>
</div>

## What is this?

This is a static api that serves science fiction quotes. If you have ever used jsonplaceholder.typicode.com it works in the same way but at sci-fi-api.netlify.com Intentions are to add a few quotes every week.

This api is also in use with [sci-fi-cli](https://github.com/JWW127/sci-fi-cli), which is just a CLI app that returns quotes from this project.
